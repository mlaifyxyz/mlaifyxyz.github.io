**Document type:** local CVE candidate assessment, **not** a published CVE Record. **CVE ID:** unassigned. **Product scope:** Anpviz IPC-D240W-S V3.5.2.1 captured from the owner's MCA40E camera; the V3.6.3.1 comparison image is an MCA50E image sent in error and was not flashed to this model.

## Finding

The active password rule accepts characters that are problematic when embedded in an RTSP URL.

**Status in this image:** original finding or lead.

**Evidence limit:** This is a usability/authentication defect; no bypass or independent security impact has been shown.

## Classification and severity

- **Proposed CWE:** [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)
- **CVSS v4.0 score:** **Not scored** — current evidence does not support a defensible numeric impact/attack vector, this version lacks the issue, or the specific defect was fixed.
- **CVSS v4.0 vector:** Not assigned.
- **Scoring basis:** This is a usability/authentication defect; no bypass or independent security impact has been shown.
- **CVE candidacy:** Needs coordinator/CNA review for grouping, affected models and version status; do not equate this finding ID with a CVE ID.

## Source screenshots

The PNGs are rendered, line-numbered excerpts of existing Ghidra C-like decompilation, **not** photographs of the Ghidra GUI or recovered vendor source. The original export is authoritative; image selection can omit relevant lines elsewhere in the function.

- No dedicated C export or code screenshot for this finding/version. See the case review and supporting evidence; no source was invented.
